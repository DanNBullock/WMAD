    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "In this notebook we will demonstrate interaction with the White Matter Anatomy Database.  In this preliminary phase, we are utilizing a jupyter notebook, as run in a [binder](https://mybinder.org/), likeley run from a [jupyterbook](https://jupyterbook.org/intro.html) website.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Database contents\n",
    "After running this first cell, you should obtain a spreadsheet-based overview of the articles currently curated by the database.  Each of the relevant columns is searchable, so you should be able to locate an article based upon characteristics like title, first author, publication year, number of tracts discussed, and the curator.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note:  running all of these cells at once will not return a desirable result, as this notebook will attempt to parse and visualize every description and figure entry in the database.  Use the subsequent two interactive spreadsheets to perform a search and thereby narrow your querry."

Coronal panels for detailed anatomical delineation of the amygdala using postmortem diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and histology (Luxol fast blue with hematoxylin–eosin staining), compared with an example of in vivo T1 and DTI images. From the postmortem DTI data, b0, trace and color-coded orientation maps are shown at 14 coronal slice levels. Panels (A,B) were from a different postmortem coronal slab than (C–N). Panel (A) corresponds to the rostral end of the amygdala that defines 0 mm to indicate the slice separation of the subsequent panels, and panel (N) shows the caudal end (13 mm). The red bounding boxes represent a 24 × 20 mm field of view at the corresponding locations on the in vivo and postmortem images with the MNI coordinates (s, sagittal; a, axial; c, coronal). Colored arrows indicate the locations of the reconstructed white matter structures shown in Figure 3. White arrows indicate the semiannular sulcus (amygdaloid fissure) defining the medial boundary of the amygdala.
