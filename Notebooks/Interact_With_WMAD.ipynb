    "After running this first cell, you should obtain a spreadsheet-based overview of the articles currently curated by the database.  Each of the relevant columns is searchable, so you should be able to locate an article based upon characteristics like title, first author, publication year, number of tracts discussed, and the curator.\n",

Once again, limitations of the diffusion methodology do not allow us to make a distinction between individual fibers bundles such as the MDLF and the ILF, although we can demonstrate that there are fibers that make direct connections with these two areas (represented as one tract in Fig. 7). These two pathways (MDLF and ILF) are included to demonstrate that information in the vicinity of the caudal Sylvian fissure reaches the inferior parietal lobule and is likely carrying auditory and visual information. These temporoparietal fibers that enter the white matter just below the inferior parietal lobule would likely be incorrectly included with fibers considered to be the arcuate fasciculus in both the classical gross dissections and more recent studies using diffusion-weighted imaging to investigate the language pathways (Catani et al., 2005; Croxson et al., 2005; Parker et al., 2005; Friederici et al., 2006; Powell et al., 2006; Anwander et al., 2007; Rilling et al., 2008), including the present study, because of the difficulty of resolving individual connections given the low resolution of diffusion data.</td>\n",

Unlike the MdLF-Ang, the MdLF-SPL’s superior terminations are located medial to the IPS and are spread along the superior parietal lobule (Fig. 9b; Lawes et al. 2008; Martino et al. 2013a; Makris et al. 2013a, 2017; Wang et al. 2013; Kamali et al. 2014a, b). Just as the morphology of the posterior MdLF-Ang mirrors the pArc, the posterior morphology of the MdLF-SPL mirrors the TP-SPL, most notably in the sheet-like character that it exhibits (Fig. 9a). The posterior termination pattern, which extends along the entirety of the superior parietal lobule, exhibits an increased density near the posterior border, in the occipitoparietal arch (Fig. 9b and Supplementary Fig. 5 and 8, Supplementary Fig. 3, area 18). Like the MdLF-Ang, there exists increased termination density in the anterior superior temporal gyrus of the anterior termination regions of the MdLF-SPL (Fig. 9c, Supplementary Fig. 3, area 3).</td>\n",

Unlike the pArc and TP-SPL, which exhibit slight but distinct differences in their coverages of the fusiform gyrus, the MdLF-SPL and MdLF-Ang are extremely similar in their anterior terminations. Indeed, the aforementioned regions of increased endpoint density in the superior temporal gyrus are found to be largely coextensive (Fig. 11c, e, Supplementary Fig. 5 and 7, Supplementary Fig. 3, area 3). As the tracts proceed posteriorly and superiorly through the temporal white matter, they begin to exhibit distinct morphologies, with the MdLF-Ang occupying more lateral white matter and the MdLF-SPL occupying more medial white matter. By the time these tracts have reached the parietal white matter, they have separated into distinct tracts, with the lateral component (the MdLF-Ang) coursing towards the inferior parietal lobule and angular gyrus, and the medial component (the MdLF-SPL) continuing vertically towards the superior parietal lobule (Fig. 11a, coronal, and b, d, Supplementary Fig. 3, areas 6, 7, 8, and 14).</td>\n",

In the case of the TP-SPL and MdLF-SPL (Fig. 12a), both tracts are noted to have their superior terminations medial to this sulcal boundary (Fig. 12b, d). The apparent discrepancy in the fullness of their termination regions is likely due to the difference in the average number of streamlines per tract (Supplementary Tables 1 and 2). The tracts share no overlap in their inferior terminations, owing to the tracts’ distinctive termination regions (superior temporal and anterior temporal gyrus for the MdLF-Ang and middle inferior temporal and fusiform gyrus for TP-SPL; Fig. 12c, e, Supplementary Fig. 3, areas 1, 3, 16).</td>\n",

The preceding discussion of Fig. 12 characterizes the relationship between the MdLF-SPL and TP-SPL, while Fig. 15 further incorporates the VOF. First, and most obviously, these three tracts connect ventral cortical areas to dorsal cortical areas. The VOF, by definition, does this in the occipital lobe, while the TP-SPL and MdLF-SPL do this for the parietal and temporal lobes. More interestingly though, they all exhibit a progression from lateral connective patterns in their inferior regions to medial connective patterns in their superior regions (Fig. 15a). Furthermore, the MdLF-SPL and TP-SPL were about the VOF in such a way that they appear to form a sheet. This anatomical proximity is more salient when looking at the occipitoparietal arch (Supplementary Fig. 3, area 18), which arises at the border of the parietal and occipital lobes. All three tracts share some endpoint density in this region (Fig. 15b–e, also see Supplementary Figs. 5–8).Finally, the MdLF (SPL and Ang) and ILF warrant additional joint consideration due to the close proximity of their posterior terminations. We begin by looking at Fig. 16a and note that the three tracts share extensive volumetric overlap in the anterior temporal lobe, indicating a common origin. However, as the tracts proceed posteriorly, they eventually split and course towards their respective posterior termination areas in the parietal and occipital lobes. Two specific regions exhibit regions of overlap, namely the occipitoparietal arch (Mai et al. 2015) (Supplementary Fig. 3, area 18) for the ILF and MdLF-SPL and the extreme posterior angular gyrus for the ILF and the MdLF-Ang (Supplementary Fig. 3, area 6). While the border between the MdLF subcomponents is fairly well defined (IPS, Supplementary Fig. 3, area 13), the border between the MdLF components and the ILF (medial ramus of transverse occipital sulcus for MdLF-Ang and superior ramus of anterior occipital sulcus for MdLF-SPL) may be difficult to definitively identify. We note that, although reported in two separate panels (Fig. 16b–e), the two subcomponents of the MdLF (Ang and SPL) can be thought of as forming a continuum with the occipital termination of the ILF.</td>\n",

       "      <td>The angular gyrus component of the middle longitudinal fasciculus (MdLF-Ang or MdLF-IPL) is a somewhat more obliquely oriented tract, as compared to the pArc and TP-SPL, and connects the temporal and parietal lobes. Specifically, it connects the anterior temporal regions to the angular gyrus, inferior parietal lobule (IPL), and some regions of posterior superior temporal gyrus (Menjot de Champfleur et al. 2013; Makris et al. 2013a, 2017; Kamali et al. 2014a, b; Bajada et al. 2015). Its posterior morphology is quite similar to the pArc and is similarly characterized by its superior terminations being located lateral to the IPS (compare Figs. 6a and 8a). In the anterior temporal lobe, a high density of terminations is noted in the anterior superior temporal gyrus (see Supplementary Fig. 5 and 8, Supplementary Fig. 3, area 3).The superior parietal lobule component of the middle longitudinal fasciculus (MdLF-SPL), like the MdLF-Ang, is an obliquely oriented tract which connects the temporal and parietal lobes. Unlike the MdLF-Ang, the MdLF-SPL’s superior terminations are located medial to the IPS and are spread along the superior parietal lobule (Fig. 9b; Lawes et al. 2008; Martino et al. 2013a; Makris et al. 2013a, 2017; Wang et al. 2013; Kamali et al. 2014a, b). Just as the morphology of the posterior MdLF-Ang mirrors the pArc, the posterior morphology of the MdLF-SPL mirrors the TP-SPL, most notably in the sheet-like character that it exhibits (Fig. 9a). The posterior termination pattern, which extends along the entirety of the superior parietal lobule, exhibits an increased density near the posterior border, in the occipitoparietal arch (Fig. 9b and Supplementary Fig. 5 and 8, Supplementary Fig. 3, area 18). Like the MdLF-Ang, there exists increased termination density in the anterior superior temporal gyrus of the anterior termination regions of the MdLF-SPL (Fig. 9c, Supplementary Fig. 3, area 3).</td>\n",

       "      <td>The two components of the MdLF, like the pArc and TP-SPL dyad, exhibit extensive volumetric overlap in the temporal lobe. Unlike the pArc and TP-SPL, which exhibit slight but distinct differences in their coverages of the fusiform gyrus, the MdLF-SPL and MdLF-Ang are extremely similar in their anterior terminations. Indeed, the aforementioned regions of increased endpoint density in the superior temporal gyrus are found to be largely coextensive (Fig. 11c, e, Supplementary Fig. 5 and 7, Supplementary Fig. 3, area 3). As the tracts proceed posteriorly and superiorly through the temporal white matter, they begin to exhibit distinct morphologies, with the MdLF-Ang occupying more lateral white matter and the MdLF-SPL occupying more medial white matter. By the time these tracts have reached the parietal white matter, they have separated into distinct tracts, with the lateral component (the MdLF-Ang) coursing towards the inferior parietal lobule and angular gyrus, and the medial component (the MdLF-SPL) continuing vertically towards the superior parietal lobule (Fig. 11a, coronal, and b, d, Supplementary Fig. 3, areas 6, 7, 8, and 14).</td>\n",

       "      <td>Although the IPS serves as a divisor for the pArc and TP-SPL as well as the subcomponents of the MdLF, it also serves as a feature of commonality. In the case of the TP-SPL and MdLF-SPL (Fig. 12a), both tracts are noted to have their superior terminations medial to this sulcal boundary (Fig. 12b, d). The apparent discrepancy in the fullness of their termination regions is likely due to the difference in the average number of streamlines per tract (Supplementary Tables 1 and 2). The tracts share no overlap in their inferior terminations, owing to the tracts’ distinctive termination regions (superior temporal and anterior temporal gyrus for the MdLF-Ang and middle inferior temporal and fusiform gyrus for TP-SPL; Fig. 12c, e, Supplementary Fig. 3, areas 1, 3, 16).Analogous to the TP-SPL and MdLF-SPL, the pArc and MdLF-Ang exhibit similarities in their dorsal morphology and terminations but significant differences in their ventral terminations (Fig. 12a). Specifically, both tracts have extensive termination density in the anterior and posterior angular gyrus (Fig. 12b, d, Supplementary Fig. 3, areas 6 and 7), while the MdLF-Ang has its ventral terminations contained within the temporal pole and anterior superior temporal gyrus (Fig. 12c, e, Supplementary Fig. 3, areas 3 and 15) and the pArc has its ventral terminations contained within the middle and inferior temporal gyri (Fig. 12c, e, Supplementary Fig. 3, areas 1 and 3). Closer inspection also reveals that the MdLF-Ang and pArc overlap in a region that may correspond to Wernicke’s area, but also differences in endpoint densities, with the MdLF-Ang proceeding further inferior and anterior in Wernicke’s area than the pArc.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Here, we further developed an automated methodology for segmenting the pArc, MdLF-Ang, MdLF-SPL, and TP-SPL. Our method utilizes ROIs from Freesurfer’s Destrieux 2009 parcellation (Destrieux et al. 2010) in a manner similar to the White Matter Query Language (WMQL; Wassermann et al. 2013, 2016). In addition to criteria described in the WMQL, we added additional criteria to ensure robustness against false-positive streamlines (Maier-Hein et al. 2017) and thereby ensure accurate tract identification. Supplementary Table 3 details the specific criteria identified by our method to segment the MdLF-SPL, MdLF-Ang, TP-SPL, and pArc. Table columns under the “WMQL-like Endpoint inclusion criteria” heading (Supplementary Table 3, green highlight) correspond to inclusion ROIs which are used to identify candidate streamlines by their endpoints. The latter two columns, labeled “Anatomically informed streamline inclusion criteria” (Supplementary Table 3, blue highlight) correspond to additional non-endpoint criteria, necessary to segment a tract. These criteria go beyond what can be done using WMQL. For example, the segmentation of the MdLF-Ang also requires that all fibers mid-points be positioned above the Thalamus.</td>\n",

These superior parietal lobule connections (MdLF-SPL) course above the previously described (Frey et al. 2008; Makris et al. 2009) MdLF-IPL (red fibers in Figs. 3a–f, 4g, i, j and 5a–d) and are inserted just above it on the superior temporal gyrus (BA 38). The MdLF-SPL fibers can clearly be distinguished from other adjacent fiber pathways such as the extreme capsule, the inferior longitudinal fascicle, AF and SLF I, II and III (Figs. 4g–j, 5a–d).  \n",

We named these fibers the MdLF-SPL as they follow the course of the previously described the MdLF-IPL from the superior temporal gyrus (BA 38) (Figs. 3a–f, 5a–c), situated superior and parallel in relation with the MdLF-IPL fibers to the confluence of the temporal and parietal lobes (Makris et al. 2009).

These fibers would be running as part of the middle longitudinal fasciculus (MDLF) (Makris et al., 2008) and in the monkey they are also the most caudal part of the inferior longitudinal fasciculus (ILF) (Petrides and Pandya, 2002b, 2006) (Fig. 7). Once again, limitations of the diffusion methodology do not allow us to make a distinction between individual fibers bundles such as the MDLF and the ILF, although we can demonstrate that there are fibers that make direct connections with these two areas (represented as one tract in Fig. 7). These two pathways (MDLF and ILF) are included to demonstrate that information in the vicinity of the caudal Sylvian fissure reaches the inferior parietal lobule and is likely carrying auditory and visual information. These temporoparietal fibers that enter the white matter just below the inferior parietal lobule would likely be incorrectly included with fibers considered to be the arcuate fasciculus in both the classical gross dissections and more recent studies using diffusion-weighted imaging to investigate the language pathways (Catani et al., 2005; Croxson et al., 2005; Parker et al., 2005; Friederici et al., 2006; Powell et al., 2006; Anwander et al., 2007; Rilling et al., 2008), including the present study, because of the difficulty of resolving individual connections given the low resolution of diffusion data.  \n",

Unlike the MdLF-Ang, the MdLF-SPL’s superior terminations are located medial to the IPS and are spread along the superior parietal lobule (Fig. 9b; Lawes et al. 2008; Martino et al. 2013a; Makris et al. 2013a, 2017; Wang et al. 2013; Kamali et al. 2014a, b). Just as the morphology of the posterior MdLF-Ang mirrors the pArc, the posterior morphology of the MdLF-SPL mirrors the TP-SPL, most notably in the sheet-like character that it exhibits (Fig. 9a). The posterior termination pattern, which extends along the entirety of the superior parietal lobule, exhibits an increased density near the posterior border, in the occipitoparietal arch (Fig. 9b and Supplementary Fig. 5 and 8, Supplementary Fig. 3, area 18). Like the MdLF-Ang, there exists increased termination density in the anterior superior temporal gyrus of the anterior termination regions of the MdLF-SPL (Fig. 9c, Supplementary Fig. 3, area 3).  \n",

Unlike the pArc and TP-SPL, which exhibit slight but distinct differences in their coverages of the fusiform gyrus, the MdLF-SPL and MdLF-Ang are extremely similar in their anterior terminations. Indeed, the aforementioned regions of increased endpoint density in the superior temporal gyrus are found to be largely coextensive (Fig. 11c, e, Supplementary Fig. 5 and 7, Supplementary Fig. 3, area 3). As the tracts proceed posteriorly and superiorly through the temporal white matter, they begin to exhibit distinct morphologies, with the MdLF-Ang occupying more lateral white matter and the MdLF-SPL occupying more medial white matter. By the time these tracts have reached the parietal white matter, they have separated into distinct tracts, with the lateral component (the MdLF-Ang) coursing towards the inferior parietal lobule and angular gyrus, and the medial component (the MdLF-SPL) continuing vertically towards the superior parietal lobule (Fig. 11a, coronal, and b, d, Supplementary Fig. 3, areas 6, 7, 8, and 14).  \n",

In the case of the TP-SPL and MdLF-SPL (Fig. 12a), both tracts are noted to have their superior terminations medial to this sulcal boundary (Fig. 12b, d). The apparent discrepancy in the fullness of their termination regions is likely due to the difference in the average number of streamlines per tract (Supplementary Tables 1 and 2). The tracts share no overlap in their inferior terminations, owing to the tracts’ distinctive termination regions (superior temporal and anterior temporal gyrus for the MdLF-Ang and middle inferior temporal and fusiform gyrus for TP-SPL; Fig. 12c, e, Supplementary Fig. 3, areas 1, 3, 16).  \n",
       "15  The TP-SPL, MdLF-SPL, and VOF are noted to exhibit several morphological similarities. The preceding discussion of Fig. 12 characterizes the relationship between the MdLF-SPL and TP-SPL, while Fig. 15 further incorporates the VOF. First, and most obviously, these three tracts connect ventral cortical areas to dorsal cortical areas. The VOF, by definition, does this in the occipital lobe, while the TP-SPL and MdLF-SPL do this for the parietal and temporal lobes. More interestingly though, they all exhibit a progression from lateral connective patterns in their inferior regions to medial connective patterns in their superior regions (Fig. 15a). Furthermore, the MdLF-SPL and TP-SPL were about the VOF in such a way that they appear to form a sheet. This anatomical proximity is more salient when looking at the occipitoparietal arch (Supplementary Fig. 3, area 18), which arises at the border of the parietal and occipital lobes. All three tracts share some endpoint density in this region (Fig. 15b–e, also see Supplementary Figs. 5–8).Finally, the MdLF (SPL and Ang) and ILF warrant additional joint consideration due to the close proximity of their posterior terminations. We begin by looking at Fig. 16a and note that the three tracts share extensive volumetric overlap in the anterior temporal lobe, indicating a common origin. However, as the tracts proceed posteriorly, they eventually split and course towards their respective posterior termination areas in the parietal and occipital lobes. Two specific regions exhibit regions of overlap, namely the occipitoparietal arch (Mai et al. 2015) (Supplementary Fig. 3, area 18) for the ILF and MdLF-SPL and the extreme posterior angular gyrus for the ILF and the MdLF-Ang (Supplementary Fig. 3, area 6). While the border between the MdLF subcomponents is fairly well defined (IPS, Supplementary Fig. 3, area 13), the border between the MdLF components and the ILF (medial ramus of transverse occipital sulcus for MdLF-Ang and superior ramus of anterior occipital sulcus for MdLF-SPL) may be difficult to definitively identify. We note that, although reported in two separate panels (Fig. 16b–e), the two subcomponents of the MdLF (Ang and SPL) can be thought of as forming a continuum with the occipital termination of the ILF.  \n",

Specifically, it connects the anterior temporal regions to the angular gyrus, inferior parietal lobule (IPL), and some regions of posterior superior temporal gyrus (Menjot de Champfleur et al. 2013; Makris et al. 2013a, 2017; Kamali et al. 2014a, b; Bajada et al. 2015). Its posterior morphology is quite similar to the pArc and is similarly characterized by its superior terminations being located lateral to the IPS (compare Figs. 6a and 8a). In the anterior temporal lobe, a high density of terminations is noted in the anterior superior temporal gyrus (see Supplementary Fig. 5 and 8, Supplementary Fig. 3, area 3).The superior parietal lobule component of the middle longitudinal fasciculus (MdLF-SPL), like the MdLF-Ang, is an obliquely oriented tract which connects the temporal and parietal lobes. Unlike the MdLF-Ang, the MdLF-SPL’s superior terminations are located medial to the IPS and are spread along the superior parietal lobule (Fig. 9b; Lawes et al. 2008; Martino et al. 2013a; Makris et al. 2013a, 2017; Wang et al. 2013; Kamali et al. 2014a, b). Just as the morphology of the posterior MdLF-Ang mirrors the pArc, the posterior morphology of the MdLF-SPL mirrors the TP-SPL, most notably in the sheet-like character that it exhibits (Fig. 9a). The posterior termination pattern, which extends along the entirety of the superior parietal lobule, exhibits an increased density near the posterior border, in the occipitoparietal arch (Fig. 9b and Supplementary Fig. 5 and 8, Supplementary Fig. 3, area 18). Like the MdLF-Ang, there exists increased termination density in the anterior superior temporal gyrus of the anterior termination regions of the MdLF-SPL (Fig. 9c, Supplementary Fig. 3, area 3).  \n",

Unlike the pArc and TP-SPL, which exhibit slight but distinct differences in their coverages of the fusiform gyrus, the MdLF-SPL and MdLF-Ang are extremely similar in their anterior terminations. Indeed, the aforementioned regions of increased endpoint density in the superior temporal gyrus are found to be largely coextensive (Fig. 11c, e, Supplementary Fig. 5 and 7, Supplementary Fig. 3, area 3). As the tracts proceed posteriorly and superiorly through the temporal white matter, they begin to exhibit distinct morphologies, with the MdLF-Ang occupying more lateral white matter and the MdLF-SPL occupying more medial white matter. By the time these tracts have reached the parietal white matter, they have separated into distinct tracts, with the lateral component (the MdLF-Ang) coursing towards the inferior parietal lobule and angular gyrus, and the medial component (the MdLF-SPL) continuing vertically towards the superior parietal lobule (Fig. 11a, coronal, and b, d, Supplementary Fig. 3, areas 6, 7, 8, and 14).  \n",

Specifically, both tracts have extensive termination density in the anterior and posterior angular gyrus (Fig. 12b, d, Supplementary Fig. 3, areas 6 and 7), while the MdLF-Ang has its ventral terminations contained within the temporal pole and anterior superior temporal gyrus (Fig. 12c, e, Supplementary Fig. 3, areas 3 and 15) and the pArc has its ventral terminations contained within the middle and inferior temporal gyri (Fig. 12c, e, Supplementary Fig. 3, areas 1 and 3). Closer inspection also reveals that the MdLF-Ang and pArc overlap in a region that may correspond to Wernicke’s area, but also differences in endpoint densities, with the MdLF-Ang proceeding further inferior and anterior in Wernicke’s area than the pArc.  \n",

While the border between the MdLF subcomponents is fairly well defined (IPS, Supplementary Fig. 3, area 13), the border between the MdLF components and the ILF (medial ramus of transverse occipital sulcus for MdLF-Ang and superior ramus of anterior occipital sulcus for MdLF-SPL) may be difficult to definitively identify. We note that, although reported in two separate panels (Fig. 16b–e), the two subcomponents of the MdLF (Ang and SPL) can be thought of as forming a continuum with the occipital termination of the ILF.  \n",

Our method utilizes ROIs from Freesurfer’s Destrieux 2009 parcellation (Destrieux et al. 2010) in a manner similar to the White Matter Query Language (WMQL; Wassermann et al. 2013, 2016). In addition to criteria described in the WMQL, we added additional criteria to ensure robustness against false-positive streamlines (Maier-Hein et al. 2017) and thereby ensure accurate tract identification. Supplementary Table 3 details the specific criteria identified by our method to segment the MdLF-SPL, MdLF-Ang, TP-SPL, and pArc. Table columns under the “WMQL-like Endpoint inclusion criteria” heading (Supplementary Table 3, green highlight) correspond to inclusion ROIs which are used to identify candidate streamlines by their endpoints. The latter two columns, labeled “Anatomically informed streamline inclusion criteria” (Supplementary Table 3, blue highlight) correspond to additional non-endpoint criteria, necessary to segment a tract. These criteria go beyond what can be done using WMQL. For example, the segmentation of the MdLF-Ang also requires that all fibers mid-points be positioned above the Thalamus.  "
