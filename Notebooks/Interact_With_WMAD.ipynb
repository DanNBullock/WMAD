    "## Introduction\n",
    "In this notebook we will demonstrate interaction with the White Matter Anatomy Database.  In this preliminary phase, we are utilizing a jupyter notebook, as run in a [binder](https://mybinder.org/), likeley run from a [jupyterbook](https://jupyterbook.org/intro.html) website.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Database contents\n",
    "After running this first cell, you should obtain a spreadsheet-based overview of the articles currently curated by the database.  Each of the relevant columns is searchable, so you should be able to locate an article based upon characteristics like title, first author, publication year, number of tracts discussed, and the curator.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note:  running all of these cells at once will not return a desirable result, as this notebook will attempt to parse and visualize every description and figure entry in the database.  Use the subsequent two interactive spreadsheets to perform a search and thereby narrow your querry."
