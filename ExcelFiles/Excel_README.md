In order to document the range of white matter structures discussed in an article, we&#39;ll have to distill out various bits of information about both the articles themselves and how they discuss the white matter structures. To do this, we&#39;ll create a folder for _each_ article we catalogue. In it there will be two categories of excel files.

- A single excel file which records information about the document itself. These should just be named &quot;article&quot;.
- Some number of excel files which record each white matter structure discussed in a sufficient amount of detail to warrant cataloging. These should just be named &quot;tract1&quot;, &quot;tract2&quot;, &quot;tract3&quot; etc.

These files can later be converted into individual JSON files, and then merged and structured into a coherent database.

Template examples for each of these cases have been placed in the &quot;ExcelFiles&quot; folder.
